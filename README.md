## CuratorAI Original Brand Identity Guidelines Prompt:
Hi, I need help creating a brand identity for my website. 

The website is curatorai, I am offering 2 services, the first is to implement RAG for museums, and the second is a headless wordpress implementation that speeds up their site, restyles it, and makes it easier to do ai integrations. My first clients will be museums/history centers, and I will move onto dentists offices and law firms. 

I want the style of the brand to be this new type of california, futurism, minimalism that I'm seeing with anthropic, higher order company, and friend.ai

I want the colors to be a muted cinematic color grading. 

I want the feel to be a type of retro futuristic nostalgia. I am going to drop in a couple pictures to explain the type of color grading I'm trying to describe. 

The purpose of the aesthetic is almost a form of anti-signal, basically saying that the product is so entrenched in the technology ecosystem that instead of trying to look sleek, it looks almost handmade, basically saying that it's not pretending to be tech, because it doesn't need to. 

The added caveat is that if you didn't know what you were doing, you would not be able to implement these designs on your website, because they're not part of some prebuilt wordpress theme, or react old react components from some design agency. 

I want the illustration to be reminiscent of old tech from the bay area via 1960s or 1970s, kind of the golden age. This aesthetic is generally really visible in perplexity's design, the tug andd pull between old and new, yet nostalgic. I want you to think hard and design something that would be approved of at a famous design agency like Smith and Diction or by a Famous designer like Frank Lloyd Wright, David Carson, Saul Bass, Stefan Sagmeister, Paula Scher, Michael Bierut, Massimo Vignelli, Milton Glaser. 

I want help conceptualizing a brand identity. I want you to create brand guidelines for me. I am going to attach screenshots that help describe the aesthetic I am trying to replicate along with the aesthetic I am looking for in the marketing material. The screenshot from anthropic represents the actual aesthetic I am looking for in the website.
