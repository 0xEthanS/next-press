        The newly expanded Veterans exhibit, 
        <strong>
            Chinese American Veterans: Unsung Heroes
        </strong>
        , opened Saturday, November 6, 2021. Chinese Americans have a long history in honorably defending America having served in every major war and conflict since the Civil War.
    </p>
    



    <p>
        A highlight of the exhibit is the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor awarded to Army PFC Lew Y. June of Morris, IL, who on January 18, 1945, in Schirrhoffen, France, died in battle by throwing himself onto a grenade to save his squad members. The Chinese American World War II Veterans Congressional Gold Medal of Honor was made possible through the efforts of Chinese American Citizens Alliance. Enacted as Public Law 115-337 in December of 2018, the first Midwest Region’s Chinese American Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony was held on October 23, 2021, in Chicago, where June and over 150 veterans were awarded this honor. In the brief period since enactment, approximately 4,000 Gold Medal honorees have been identified. Previous recipients include George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Harry S. Truman, the Native American Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen, and Nisei and Filipino soldiers. 
    </p>



    
    <p>
        Called into service in early 1941 prior to the U.S. joining World War II, many Chinese Americans joined an air unit nicknamed “Flying Tigers” to defend against aerial attacks. An estimated 20,000 Chinese Americans eventually served in World War II in all branches of the Armed Forces and in all t heaters of war. They have been distinguished with individual citations from Combat Infantry Badges, Purple Hearts to Bronze and Silver Stars and Distinguished Crosses, including the Medal of Honor, as well as unit citations for valor and bravery. 
    </p>
    



    <p>
        Chinese American military service women were also indispensable to the success of World War II. Not allowed in combat, they performed essential functions such as intelligence gathering, flying critical logistics missions, training male pilots and ferrying combat aircraft, and providing medical care as nurses and rehabilitation therapists. Many women also joined voluntary service organizations to support the war effort. 
    </p>
    



    <p>
        World War II served as a pivotal point in Chinese American history. The exclusionary period starting with the Page Act in 1875, followed by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, that lasted well into the 1960s, began to lift with the Magnuson Act of 1943. Many who served in World ​War II were granted citizenship. The bachelor society that characterized Chinese American life to this point was transformed through the Chinese War Brides Act of 1946, when over 6,000 Chinese women were allowed to reunite with their husbands and fiancés in the U.S. The “G.I.” Bill of 1944 offered educational, housing and loan opportunities that addressed barriers many Chinese Americans faced previously. 
    </p>



    
    <p>
        Another highlight of the exhibit is an updated Honor Roll of Illinois Chinese American Military Service Men and Women. The number of names has almost tripled to 700 from the original roster. The public is asked to contact the museum with any additions to this list. 
    </p>
    



    <p>
        The history of the Chicago Chinatown American Legion Post 1003 whose effect on veterans’ post-war civilian lives, and community-building youth programs such as the Wah Mei Drum and Bugle Corps and the Boy Scouts, is also be featured. 
    </p>



    
    <p>
        Among the veteran portraits, original uniforms and documents, additional medals from other wars, and other museum artifacts are on display.

        Thanks to a generous grant from the Chicago Community Trust, the Chinese American Museum of Chicago is collaborating with the Chicago History Museum to bring its wonderful object theater and 16-minute video 
        <em>
            My Chinatown
        </em> 
        to the Chinese American Museum of Chicago! Hear the stories of the people of Chinatown &#8211; their journeys, their customs, their work, their families &#8211; from within Chinatowns borders.
    </p>
    



    <p>
        CAMOC is adding a special feature to the exhibit: a look at family associations in Chinatown. As an outgrowth of the Chicago Chinatown Centennial Exhibit, we will be highlighting, on a rotating basis, the histories and artifacts of various family associations, including the Lees, the Wongs, and more.

        features the work of artist Thandi Cai and new glimpses into the CAMOC archives. This show delves into the intricate relationship between kinship networks and commerce that shaped the spread of Chinatowns, which hold at their core a sense of disconnection&#8211;between generations, between those within and beyond Chinatown, and between museum collections and lived histories.</p><p>On View: November 9, 2024 &#8211; March 31, 2025

        <strong>
            Thandi Cai (they/them)
        </strong> 
        is a queer Indonesian and Chinese American artist from the American South exploring futurities of Asian diasporic identity through critical dialogue, textiles, performance, film, graphic design, and print media.
    </p>
    



    <p>
        At the core of their creative and socially engaged practice is a desire to steer the world into a future that breaks free from colonial systems of gender binaries, nation-states, and capital. The goal of their work is to arouse imagination, pleasure, and improvisation to ideate new paths forward. Cai is immersed in researching and riffing off of histories where they find themselves and other Asian Americans absent (despite their irrefutable presence) to fabulate speculative fiction in which they are centered.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        In 2020 Cai co-founded Meng Cheng Artist Collective in service of collective artmaking and dialogue in the Memphis community.  They are currently collaborating with the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis &amp; the Midsouth in the creation of Bluff City Chinese, a documentary about the expansive voices of the Chinese diaspora in Memphis.

        The CAMOC Archive Series proudly presents New Women, a special month-long program to celebrate International Women’s Day.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        Since 2017, we have conducted a series of interviews with 18 women from Chicago’s Chinatown, documenting their oral histories and personal narratives. The collection features the voices of Anita Lau, Annie Lowe, Bernie Wong, Celia Cheung, Christine Woo, Elaine Louie, Esther Wong, Grace Chun, Josephine Luck, Mabel Moy, Mary Jean Chan, Marylin Leung, May Young Chin, Ruby Wong, Sharyne Moy, Sun Yee Moy, Ying Ye Lee, and Yuk Chi Lay.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        To honor their stories, we are presenting a special installation to share these recorded histories alongside printed materials, displayed in the museum’s south-facing windows on our second floor. This initiative amplifies the voices and experiences of Chinatown’s women, whose contributions remain underrepresented in historical discourse.
